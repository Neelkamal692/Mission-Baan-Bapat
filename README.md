## 3. Problem Statement :
### To analyse the performance of recommendation systems when applied on distinctively segmented customer base of an E-commerce company.
35% of Amazon.comâ€™s revenue is generated by its recommendation system. Needless to say, how *Recommendation Systems* are shaping e-commerce industry.
But no system is 100% efficient so does recommendation systems, infact recommendation system are primarily based on theory of probability that user might purchase the item given his purchase history/ search history/ interest etc.So it would have some initial accuracy. This is the first part of the puzzle, for the second part , E-commerce companies segment their customers based on some factors in order to target the different segments strtegically and efficiently. So we'll make clusters of customers and apply the recommendation system     
1. Iniatially, Recommendation System will be tested on complete dataset. (Say) Recommendation_System0
2. Clustering of customer data will be done and let's say we get 3 clusters namely cluster1, cluster2 and cluster3  
3. 3 different recommendation system (say) recommendation_System1, recommendation_System2, recommendation_System3 will be applied on cluster1, cluster2 and          cluster3 respectively and then their accuracies will be averaged out
4. Accuracy of Recommendation_system0 will be compared with the above 3 recommendation systems.
