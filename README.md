## 3. Problem Statement :
### To analyse the performance of recommendation systems when applied on distinctively segmented customer base of an E-commerce company.
Needless to say,*Recommendation Systems* are shaping e-commerce industry, evidently 35% of Amazon.comâ€™s revenue is generated by its recommendation system.
But no recommendation systems is 100% accurate, infact recommendation system are primarily based on theory of probability that user might purchase the item given his purchase history/ search history/ interest etc. So, Our primary objective is to determine the performance of recommendation systems.But this is the first part of the problem, for the next part,we know that E-commerce companies divide their customers based on some factors in order to target the different segments strtegically and efficiently. Hoping, segmentation will yeild better recommendations when user is divided based on their preference. So we'll make clusters of customers and apply the recommendation systems on individual clusters and try to analys the results

1. Iniatially, Recommendation System will be tested on complete dataset. (Say) Recommendation_System0
2. Clustering of customer data will be done and let's say we get 3 clusters namely cluster1, cluster2 and cluster3  
3. 3 different recommendation system (say) recommendation_System1, recommendation_System2, recommendation_System3 will be applied on cluster1, cluster2 and          cluster3 respectively and then their accuracies will be averaged out
4. Accuracy of Recommendation_system0 will be compared with the above 3 recommendation systems.

[Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=olist_order_items_dataset.csv)
This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Dataset consists of 9 different csv files which in turn consists information such as Customer demographics, order details, product info and review etc.
